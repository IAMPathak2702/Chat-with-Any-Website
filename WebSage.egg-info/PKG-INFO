Welcome to WebSage, a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) based chatbot designed to chat with any website. This project leverages cutting-edge technologies such as OpenAI's GPT, Langchain, and FAISS to provide efficient retrieval and interaction with web content.
Web Content Interaction: Utilizes BeautifulSoup4 for web scraping and content extraction, enabling the chatbot to interact with live web pages and retrieve relevant information.
FastAPI Integration: Offers a seamless API endpoint for easy interaction with the chatbot, facilitating integration with other applications and services.
Langchain for LLM: Manages and interacts with language models using Langchain, ensuring robust and scalable conversational AI capabilities.
FAISS Vector Database: Employs FAISS for fast and efficient similarity search and retrieval, enhancing the chatbot's ability to find and provide accurate information from large datasets.
Environment Variables: Configurable via a .env file, allowing easy setup and management of API keys and other critical settings.
WebSage combines the power of advanced AI technologies to deliver a versatile and efficient chatbot capable of interacting with any website, making it an invaluable tool for various applications.
